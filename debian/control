Description: Library for compressing 3D geometric meshes and point clouds
 Draco is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes
 and point clouds. It is intended to improve the storage and transmission
 of 3D graphics.
 .
 Draco is designed and built for compression efficiency and speed. The code
 supports compressing points, connectivity information, texture coordinates,
 color information, normals, and any other generic attributes associated with
 geometry. With Draco, applications using 3D graphics can be significantly
 smaller without compromising visual fidelity. For users, this means apps can
 now be downloaded faster, 3D graphics in the browser can load quicker, and VR
 and AR scenes can now be transmitted with a fraction of the bandwidth and
 rendered quickly.
